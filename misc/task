1.
    Declare two variables: admin and guest.
    Assign the value "John" to the variable guest.
    Copy the value from guest to admin.
    Show the value of admin using console.log(must output “John”).


2.
	Define a forloop that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.


3.
    Write a function min(a,b) which returns the least of two numbers a and b. (hint: check conditional statement and functions)
	e.g min(2,5) should return 2


4.
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 i.e 15, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
